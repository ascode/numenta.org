# Active Ports of NuPIC

NuPIC is open source and GPLv3. We encourage others to port our implementation
of HTM into their language of choice. Below is a list of active ports the NuPIC
community has been working on.

## [htm.java](https://github.com/numenta/htm.java) (Java)

This is a direct port of the NuPIC Python API implemented in Java, led by
[David Ray](https://github.com/cogmission). This codebase is a controlled and
guided by Numenta, but is entirely implemented by the NuPIC community.
