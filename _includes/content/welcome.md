**NuPIC** is an open source Platform and Community for Machine Intelligence.
NuPIC learns patterns in both space and time, predicts future values, and
detects anomalies found in realtime streams of data. Our unique technology,
**Hierarchical Temporal Memory**, is based on the neurobiological principles of
the human brain. NuPIC can run anywhere, including on embedded systems and
distributed sensors.
