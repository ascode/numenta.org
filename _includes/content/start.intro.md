Get started with NuPIC. Here we'll help you download, install, and run it for
the first time.

Please consider that NuPIC is based on principles of which most people are not
familiar, including Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), Sparse Distributed
Representations (SDRs), online learning, and distributed memory. There is a
steeper-than-normal learning curve.
