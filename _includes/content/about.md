# About Numenta

Numenta, Inc. was formed in 2005 to develop biologically-inspired machine
intelligence technology for both commercial and scientific use. To achieve this
goal we are fully documenting our progress and discoveries. We also publish our
software in a form that other people can use for both research and commercial
development. We have structured our software to encourage the emergence of an
independent, application developer community. Use of Numentaâ€™s software and
intellectual property is free for research purposes. We will generate revenue by
selling support, licensing software, and licensing intellectual property for
commercial deployments. We always will seek to make our developer partners
successful, as well as be successful ourselves.

Numenta is based in Redwood City, California. It is privately funded.
